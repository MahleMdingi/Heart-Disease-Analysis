Insights:

While the dataset provided key clinical metrics, it was limited in scope—particularly lacking detailed health history and lifestyle data prior to diagnosis. This restricted the ability to uncover early predictors or nuanced patterns related to heart disease risk. Nevertheless, the analysis indicates that heart disease disproportionately affects males, especially those aged 50 and above. Notably, individuals with heart disease displayed lower average cholesterol levels compared to their healthier counterparts, which may reflect post-diagnosis lifestyle changes or the use of cholesterol-lowering medications.

Recommendations:

To enhance future analyses and support more targeted interventions, it is recommended that the clinic collect more comprehensive patient data, including medical history and lifestyle habits. In the interim, awareness campaigns should focus on men entering their 50s—highlighting the risks of heart disease and promoting preventive strategies such as routine screening, dietary adjustments, and physical activity. These efforts can support early detection and contribute to better long-term outcomes.
